# XGboost-ETF-predcition

This repo contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores combining technical indicators and XGboost to predict the movement direction and the price of the QQQ index. This is accomplished by combining two appraoches:

1. The first approach uses XGboost as a classifier to predict whether the close price will increase the folloiwng day. 
2. The second approach uses Xhboost as a regression technique to predict the close price the following day.
